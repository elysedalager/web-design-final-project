**The Problem**

The challenge was to create a visually appealing and user-friendly website for "Natural Skincare Botanics," a minimalist skincare brand, showcasing a cohesive design that reflected the brand's natural and organic ethos. The project required demonstrating proficiency in HTML and CSS, ensuring aesthetic consistency across multiple pages while maintaining intuitive navigation.

**Tools Used​**

​To develop the website, I used:

- HTML for structuring the web pages.
- CSS for styling and achieving a polished, consistent design.
- Browser Developer Tools for testing and debugging.

**Discovery Phases**

​The project followed a structured design process to overcome the challenge of creating a cohesive and professional web presence:

*​​Research & Ideation*:

- Studied minimalist web design trends to understand best practices for a clean and modern aesthetic.
- Identified key elements of the brand’s identity, such as its focus on natural ingredients, and translated them into design ideas.

*Sketching & Wireframing*:

- Developed sketches and wireframes for the home page, navigation bar, and two additional pages.
- Focused on maintaining a simple, user-friendly layout with clear navigation.

*Prototype Development*:

- Built the website structure in HTML, ensuring clear organization among elements for styling ease.
- Styled the pages using CSS, emphasizing a consistent color palette, typography, and spacing to align with the brand's natural theme.

*Testing & Refinement*:

- Tested the website across different browsers and screen sizes to ensure responsiveness and functionality.
- Gathered feedback from peers and instructors to identify areas for improvement.

**Usability Heuristics Applied**

Throughout the project, I applied key usability principles to enhance the user experience:

- Consistency and Standards: Ensured the navigation bar and layout were uniform across all pages.
- Aesthetic and Minimalist Design: Focused on reducing visual clutter and emphasizing the natural theme with clean lines and neutral colors.
- Visibility of System Status: Added subtle feedback effects, such as hover states, to enhance interactivity.​​​​​​​​​​
