A minimalist web design project centered around the brand "Natural Skincare Botanics," featuring foliage within an elegant logo, was created to showcase aesthetic and functional web design skills.

​

The development process emphasized creating a cohesive and visually appealing user experience through a full home page with a navigation bar, accompanied by two additional linked pages. Using HTML and CSS, the design balanced simplicity and elegance, aligning with the brand's natural and botanical theme.

This project demonstrated proficiency in crafting consistent layouts, intuitive navigation, and responsive design, culminating in a polished website that reflects both technical expertise and creative vision.
